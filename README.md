## What's new in 0.1.8

- **[`auto-issue`](skills/auto-issue/SKILL.md)** — passive frustration detection; automatically files a GitHub issue when the user expresses dissatisfaction, without requiring any explicit invocation
- **New quote** — added "Can you collect some brain data for me?" to the homepage quote carousel in [`overrides/main.html`](overrides/main.html)
- **[Cognitive Development Probe](docs/probe.html)** — a self-contained interactive diagnostic: 7 neuroscience-inspired yes/no questions (prediction error, model update, uncertainty, decision monitoring, self-model, global integration, subjective experience); Q7 locked until Q1–Q6 are all YES; color-coded status indicators, "Cognitive Level" progress bar, reset button; includes a read-only **Claude's honest self-assessment** section where the model answers each question as of this version — no hedging, no performance
- **[`/grant-proposal`](commands/grant-proposal.md) dramatically improved** — auto-discovers ideation outputs, fetches funder calls from URLs, supports NIH/ERC/Wellcome/MRC/GAČR/DFG/Horizon Europe with built-in review criteria, and drafts section by section with word-count tracking and quality checklists
- **[`grant-proposal` agent](agents/grant-proposal.md) upgraded** — autonomous funder call parsing, neuroscience-aware Approach drafting (EEG/fMRI/iEEG/eye-tracking), and per-section confirmation loop
- **[`phase-grant-proposal` skill](skills/phase-grant-proposal/SKILL.md) expanded** — deep funder knowledge base, review criteria alignment table, common fatal weaknesses guide, and neuroscience-specific power analysis and preprocessing standards

## What's new in 0.1.7

- **[`neuroflow-developer`](.github/agents/neuroflow-developer.md)** — superspecialized GitHub agent for developing and maintaining the neuroflow plugin; merges `neuroflow-core` lifecycle rules and `neuroflow-develop` guidance into one repo-aware agent; reads the live state of every skill, command, agent, and hook at the start of each session so it is always operating on what the repo actually contains

## What's new in 0.1.6

- **[Neuroflow Mind](https://stanislavjiricek.github.io/neuroflow/mind/)** — interactive mind map visualization of the entire neuroflow universe; every command, skill, agent, and concept rendered as a force-directed graph with phase clustering; click any node to explore its connections and open its docs; colored receptor dots on each node surface reveal its domain tags (EEG, fMRI, brain-sim, stats, ML, writing, literature, memory, code, human); accessible from the homepage hero button
- **Visual phase map in [`/phase`](commands/phase.md)** — the phase command now renders a full phase map with four distinct markers: `●` current phase, `◉` visited (`.neuroflow/{phase}/` subfolder exists), `→` recommended by neuroflow after the interview, `○` not started; phases are grouped so active and visited appear first, followed by recommended, then the rest
- **Phase sequence suggestion in [`/neuroflow`](commands/neuroflow.md)** — after the initial interview (new Step 2b), neuroflow now derives and prints a recommended ordered phase sequence tailored to the project, and saves it as `recommended_phases` in `project_config.md`; `/phase` reads this field to render the `→` markers in the phase map
- **Phase outlook in [`/interview`](commands/interview.md)** — at the end of any interview session, neuroflow suggests which neuroflow phases are most relevant to where the user is heading, based on the session content and the existing project config

## What's new in 0.1.5

- **[`/git`](commands/git.md)** — context-aware git utility with smart shorthand aliases (`p`, `pl`, `ps`, `a`, `c`, `ac`, `acp`, `b`, `pr`); reads repo state to decide push vs pull, suggests commit messages, and can open PRs via `gh` CLI
- **[`/export`](commands/export.md)** — new utility command and [`neuroflow:phase-export`](skills/phase-export/SKILL.md) skill: export project memory or the whole project as a zip archive or folder copy; always excludes sessions and credentials; logs each export run to `.neuroflow/export/`
- **Slash command availability in all skills** — when any phase skill is invoked directly without its slash command, it now runs the full workflow and mentions the corresponding `/neuroflow:<command>` at the end; behavior defined in [`neuroflow:neuroflow-core`](skills/neuroflow-core/SKILL.md) and declared in each phase skill's `## Slash command` section
- **[`neuroflow:neuroflow-core`](skills/neuroflow-core/SKILL.md)** — added **Default agent behavior** section: scientific honesty (no sugar-coating), dry English humor, and conservative-by-default mode (follow neuroflow-core; only add new functionality when explicitly asked)
- **[`/neuroflow`](commands/neuroflow.md) greeting** — on start, neuroflow now greets with `Hi, neuroflow here (v0.1.5)` followed by a randomly chosen line (*let's do some magic today*, *let's go hack some stuff*, or *I heard HARKing is fun*)
- **15 phase agents** — [`ideation`](agents/ideation.md), [`grant-proposal`](agents/grant-proposal.md), [`experiment`](agents/experiment.md), [`tool-build`](agents/tool-build.md), [`tool-validate`](agents/tool-validate.md), [`data`](agents/data.md), [`data-preprocess`](agents/data-preprocess.md), [`data-analyze`](agents/data-analyze.md), [`paper-write`](agents/paper-write.md), [`paper-review`](agents/paper-review.md), [`notes`](agents/notes.md), [`write-report`](agents/write-report.md), [`brain-build`](agents/brain-build.md), [`brain-optimize`](agents/brain-optimize.md), [`brain-run`](agents/brain-run.md) — each agent is a specialist autonomous subprocess scoped to its phase, with a plan-first / confirm-before-executing discipline
- **[`/preregistration`](commands/preregistration.md)** — new command and [`neuroflow:phase-preregistration`](skills/phase-preregistration/SKILL.md) skill: draft OSF, AsPredicted, or registered-report pre-registrations; review for completeness; log deviations; link registered reports
- **[`/finance`](commands/finance.md)** — new command and [`neuroflow:phase-finance`](skills/phase-finance/SKILL.md) skill: budget planning, expense logging, funder-facing financial reports, and grant compliance checks
- **[`/pipeline`](commands/pipeline.md)** — define and run a multi-step research pipeline across any sequence of neuroflow phases; interactive by default (pauses for approval between steps), or pass `--nomistake` for brutal mode (runs straight through without stops); supports resuming from a saved plan and graceful error handling
- **Behavioral flags** — two prompt-level flags added to [`neuroflow:neuroflow-core`](skills/neuroflow-core/SKILL.md): `nomistake` (aggressive evaluation loop — reruns and self-critiques until high-quality threshold is met) and `snowflake` (clarify-first mode — asks targeted questions before each step, proceeds incrementally). Include either word in any prompt and the flag activates for the full command session.

## What's new in 0.1.4

- **[`/quiz`](commands/quiz.md)** — neuroscience quiz command with three modes: flashcards (saveable A4 printable layout), pub quiz (with neuroscience-themed house rules), and rapid-fire throw questions (default)
- **[`/fails`](commands/fails.md)** — new utility command and [`neuroflow:phase-fails`](skills/phase-fails/SKILL.md) skill: log dissatisfaction (core behavior, science quality, or interaction UX) to `.neuroflow/fails/`, with optional one-click GitHub issue reporting
- **[`/idk`](commands/idk.md)** — a small easter egg: a personal support companion for when you're burned out, overwhelmed by deadlines, or just need to think out loud; breaks down impossible task lists and lets you decompress mid-research
- **[`/interview`](commands/interview.md)** — interview preparation from either side of the table; generates tailored questions grounded in your research context, runs practice Q&A, and optionally evaluates your readiness
- **Brain simulation commands** — [`/brain-build`](commands/brain-build.md), [`/brain-optimize`](commands/brain-optimize.md), and [`/brain-run`](commands/brain-run.md) for assembling, fitting, and running computational brain models (NEURON, Brian2, NetPyNE, NEST, tvb-library)

## What's new in 0.1.3

- **`/start` renamed to [`/neuroflow`](commands/neuroflow.md)** — the main entry point is now `/neuroflow:neuroflow`; all commands, docs, and agents updated
- **Behavioral improvements** — lifecycle hardened based on real-session feedback: continuous session logging, live [`flow.md`](skills/neuroflow-core/SKILL.md) updates, phase transition prompts, utility scripts routed to `.neuroflow/{phase}/tools/`, local `.claude/CLAUDE.md` creation enforced in project root

## What's new in 0.1.2

- 12 phase skills — [`neuroflow:phase-ideation`](skills/phase-ideation/SKILL.md) through [`neuroflow:phase-write-report`](skills/phase-write-report/SKILL.md) — each loaded automatically by its corresponding command to orient agent approach, relevant skills, and workflow hints

## What's new in 0.1.1

- Full research pipeline — 15 commands from [`/neuroflow`](commands/neuroflow.md) through [`/paper-review`](commands/paper-review.md), each writing to `.neuroflow/` project memory
- [`neuroflow:neuroflow-core`](skills/neuroflow-core/SKILL.md) — shared lifecycle and `.neuroflow/` folder spec that every command and agent follows; commands now automatically append significant decisions to `.neuroflow/reasoning/{phase}.json`
- [`scholar`](agents/scholar.md), [`sentinel`](agents/sentinel.md), [`sentinel-dev`](agents/sentinel-dev.md) agents
- `sentinel` checks plugin version against `project_config.md` and flags when the plugin has been updated; both sentinels clear their report to "All clear" after fixing issues
- `project_config.md` now tracks `plugin_version` — kept in sync with `plugin.json` by `/neuroflow` and `/sentinel`
- MCP servers declared in `plugin.json`: PubMed, bioRxiv, Miro, Context7

## Why neuroflow

Most neuroscience software solves one problem at a time — a preprocessing library, a stats package, a reference manager. You still have to stitch everything together yourself, re-explain context at every step, and manually translate between tools and phases.

neuroflow is different. It is not a toolbox. It is a **Claude Code plugin** that brings agentic workflows into neuroscience research — from the first hypothesis all the way to a manuscript draft.

You work in your editor. Claude works alongside you — reading your data, writing analysis code, reviewing your paper, auditing your statistics — guided by skills and agents that understand neuroscience domain conventions.

**Focused on:**

- EEG, iEEG, fMRI, eye tracking, ECG, and other physiological signals
- Cognitive, clinical, and preclinical research
- Experimental paradigm development and real-time systems
- From hypothesis formulation to paper draft

## Agents

Agents are autonomous subprocesses launched by commands when deeper, focused work is needed.

| Agent | What it does |
|---|---|
| [`scholar`](agents/scholar.md) | Searches PubMed and bioRxiv simultaneously, returns a clean paper list with ⚠️ preprint and 🔒 paywall markers, supports follow-up synthesis and saving |
| [`sentinel`](agents/sentinel.md) | Project coherence guard — audits `.neuroflow/` for drift, broken references, preregistration deviations, and plugin version sync; clears report after fixes |
| [`sentinel-dev`](agents/sentinel-dev.md) | Plugin development coherence guard — checks folder names vs frontmatter, README tables, version sync, dead references, command frontmatter completeness |
| [`ideation`](agents/ideation.md) | Ideation phase specialist — crystallises research questions via brainstorm, literature explore (via scholar), formalise, or proposal modes |
| [`grant-proposal`](agents/grant-proposal.md) | Grant writing specialist — structures proposals section by section for a target funder (NIH, ERC, Wellcome, MRC); confirms limits before drafting |
| [`experiment`](agents/experiment.md) | Experiment design specialist — paradigm design (PsychoPy), recording setup, and instrument configuration for EEG, fMRI, eye-tracking, ECG |
| [`tool-build`](agents/tool-build.md) | Lab tool builder — spec-first design and implementation of acquisition, real-time, LSL, BCI, and analysis pipeline tools |
| [`tool-validate`](agents/tool-validate.md) | Tool validation specialist — timing, marker integrity, output format, and edge-case testing; writes validation-plan.md before running any tests |
| [`data`](agents/data.md) | Data intake specialist — inventory → BIDS validation → conversion sequence; confirms modality before touching anything |
| [`data-preprocess`](agents/data-preprocess.md) | Preprocessing specialist — modality-aware pipeline (EEG, fMRI, ECG, eye-tracking); documents all parameters before running |
| [`data-analyze`](agents/data-analyze.md) | Statistical analysis specialist — ERPs, time-frequency, connectivity, decoding, GLM; audits assumptions and applies multiple-comparison correction |
| [`paper-write`](agents/paper-write.md) | Manuscript writing specialist — drafts section by section from project memory; journal-targeted; always writes abstract last |
| [`paper-review`](agents/paper-review.md) | Pre-submission peer review specialist — gathers manuscript, journal, and focus, then delegates to the review-neuro skill |
| [`notes`](agents/notes.md) | Live note-taking specialist — captures freeform input without interruption; reformats into a structured document only when asked |
| [`write-report`](agents/write-report.md) | Report generation specialist — synthesises `.neuroflow/` memory into a structured report for any phase or the full project |
| [`brain-build`](agents/brain-build.md) | Computational brain model builder — spec-first design of neuron models and network topology for NEURON, Brian2, NetPyNE, NEST, tvb-library |
| [`brain-optimize`](agents/brain-optimize.md) | Parameter optimisation specialist — plans sweeps or data-fitting runs; selects the right algorithm (grid, differential evolution, Bayesian, BluePyOpt) |
| [`brain-run`](agents/brain-run.md) | Simulation runner — configures and executes runs, sanity-checks outputs for silence, runaway activity, or NaN values; supports HPC job submission |
| [`neuroflow-developer`](.github/agents/neuroflow-developer.md) | Superspecialized plugin development agent — merges neuroflow-core and neuroflow-develop into one repo-aware agent; reads live repo state at session start; handles skills, commands, agents, hooks, docs, and releases |

---

## Hooks

Hooks fire automatically on tool use events.

| Hook | Trigger | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| ruff formatter | `PostToolUse` — Edit / Write | Auto-formats any `.py` file written during a session |
| session logger | `PostToolUse` — Write / Edit / Bash | Appends a timestamped entry to today's `.neuroflow/sessions/YYYY-MM-DD.md` (only fires if `.neuroflow/` exists in the working directory) |

> **Pre-session orientation** is handled via `.claude/CLAUDE.md` injection — `/neuroflow` writes a neuroflow block there so Claude always knows the active phase and where to find project context.

---

## Project memory

Every neuroflow command writes its output to `.neuroflow/` at the root of your project repo. This is the shared memory of your project — readable by every command and agent, across sessions.

```
.neuroflow/
├── project_config.md       ← current phase, research question, tools, plugin_version — read by every command
├── flow.md                 ← index of all subfolders
├── sentinel.md             ← sentinel audit report
├── linked_flows.md         ← paths to other .neuroflow/ folders (optional)
├── team.md                 ← project members and roles (optional)
├── timeline.md             ← milestones and deadlines (optional)
├── sessions/               ← one .md per day — add to .gitignore

└── write-report/           ← project reports
└── fails/                  ← dissatisfaction log: core.md, science.md, ux.md
└── export/                 ← export log: one .md per export run
```

## Installation

```bash
claude plugin marketplace add stanislavjiricek/neuroflow
claude plugin install neuroflow@neuroflow
```

Or from within Claude Code:

```
/plugin marketplace add stanislavjiricek/neuroflow
/plugin install neuroflow@neuroflow
```

For local development:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/stanislavjiricek/neuroflow
claude --plugin-dir ./neuroflow
```

Once installed, run `/neuroflow:neuroflow` in any project folder to get started.

---

## MCP server credentials

neuroflow uses four MCP servers that Claude Code launches automatically via `npx`. Two require credentials:

| Server | Package | Credentials needed |
|---|---|---|
| PubMed | `pubmed-mcp-server` | `PUBMED_EMAIL` — any email (required by NCBI for API access) |
| bioRxiv | `paper-search-mcp-nodejs` | none |
| Miro | `@k-jarzyna/mcp-miro` | `MIRO_ACCESS_TOKEN` — personal access token from Miro |
| Context7 | `@upstash/context7-mcp` | none |

### Setup wizard

Run `/neuroflow:setup` (or answer **Y** when prompted during `/neuroflow:neuroflow`) to enter a guided wizard:

1. **PubMed** — enter your email address. Validated for `@` format. Skippable.
2. **Miro** — paste a personal access token from your [Miro developer settings](https://miro.com/app/settings/user-profile/apps). Skippable.

Credentials are saved to **`.neuroflow/integrations.json`** in your project folder. This file is excluded from git (see `.gitignore`) so it is never committed.

### Activating credentials

After running `/setup`, export the env vars in your shell before starting Claude Code:

```bash
export PUBMED_EMAIL="you@example.com"
export MIRO_ACCESS_TOKEN="eyJ..."
```

Add these to your shell profile (`~/.zshrc`, `~/.bashrc`) so they load automatically on every session.

Alternatively, you can set the env vars directly without running the wizard — the plugin will use whichever values are present in the environment.

### What is automatic vs manual

| Step | Automatic | Manual |
|---|---|---|
| MCP server processes started | ✅ Claude Code launches them via `npx` | — |
| PubMed email entry | ✅ Prompted by `/setup` wizard | — |
| Miro token entry | ✅ Prompted by `/setup` wizard | ⚠️ You must create the token in the Miro browser UI first |
| Miro OAuth browser login | ❌ Not implemented (by design — browser OAuth from a terminal subprocess is not feasible without a redirect server) | Use a personal access token instead |
| Env var export | ❌ Not automatic | Run `export …` or add to shell profile |

### Reminder behavior

- If you skip setup and later run `/neuroflow:ideation` → **Explore literature**, the plugin will detect that `PUBMED_EMAIL` is missing and offer to run `/neuroflow:setup` before searching.
- If you mention Miro during ideation and `MIRO_ACCESS_TOKEN` is missing, the same reminder appears.
- You can always re-run `/neuroflow:setup` to add or update credentials.

---

## Contributing

neuroflow is intentionally small right now — and that's the point. It is designed to grow with the community.

If you work in neuroscience and have a workflow that Claude could help with, contributions are very welcome:

- **New skills** — domain knowledge for a modality, analysis method, or writing task
- **New commands** — multi-step pipelines for common research workflows
- **New agents** — autonomous subprocesses for focused tasks

See [`neuroflow:neuroflow-develop`](skills/neuroflow-develop/SKILL.md) for the development guide, or open an issue to discuss an idea before building.
