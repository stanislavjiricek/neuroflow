## What's new in 0.1.4

- **Brain simulation commands** — [`/brain-build`](commands/brain-build.md), [`/brain-optimize`](commands/brain-optimize.md), and [`/brain-run`](commands/brain-run.md) for assembling, fitting, and running computational brain models (NEURON, Brian2, NetPyNE, NEST, tvb-library)

## What's new in 0.1.3

- **`/start` renamed to [`/neuroflow`](commands/neuroflow.md)** — the main entry point is now `/neuroflow:neuroflow`; all commands, docs, and agents updated
- **Behavioral improvements** — lifecycle hardened based on real-session feedback: continuous session logging, live [`flow.md`](skills/neuroflow-core/SKILL.md) updates, phase transition prompts, utility scripts routed to `.neuroflow/{phase}/tools/`, local `.claude/CLAUDE.md` creation enforced in project root

## What's new in 0.1.2

- 12 phase skills — [`neuroflow:phase-ideation`](skills/phase-ideation/SKILL.md) through [`neuroflow:phase-write-report`](skills/phase-write-report/SKILL.md) — each loaded automatically by its corresponding command to orient agent approach, relevant skills, and workflow hints

## What's new in 0.1.1

- Full research pipeline — 15 commands from [`/neuroflow`](commands/neuroflow.md) through [`/paper-review`](commands/paper-review.md), each writing to `.neuroflow/` project memory
- [`neuroflow:neuroflow-core`](skills/neuroflow-core/SKILL.md) — shared lifecycle and `.neuroflow/` folder spec that every command and agent follows; commands now automatically append significant decisions to `.neuroflow/reasoning/{phase}.json`
- [`scholar`](agents/scholar.md), [`sentinel`](agents/sentinel.md), [`sentinel-dev`](agents/sentinel-dev.md) agents
- `sentinel` checks plugin version against `project_config.md` and flags when the plugin has been updated; both sentinels clear their report to "All clear" after fixing issues
- `project_config.md` now tracks `plugin_version` — kept in sync with `plugin.json` by `/neuroflow` and `/sentinel`
- MCP servers declared in `plugin.json`: PubMed, bioRxiv, Miro, Context7

## Why neuroflow

Most neuroscience software solves one problem at a time — a preprocessing library, a stats package, a reference manager. You still have to stitch everything together yourself, re-explain context at every step, and manually translate between tools and phases.

neuroflow is different. It is not a toolbox. It is a **Claude Code plugin** that brings agentic workflows into neuroscience research — from the first hypothesis all the way to a manuscript draft.

You work in your editor. Claude works alongside you — reading your data, writing analysis code, reviewing your paper, auditing your statistics — guided by skills and agents that understand neuroscience domain conventions.

**Focused on:**

- EEG, iEEG, fMRI, eye tracking, ECG, and other physiological signals
- Cognitive, clinical, and preclinical research
- Experimental paradigm development and real-time systems
- From hypothesis formulation to paper draft

## Agents

Agents are autonomous subprocesses launched by commands when deeper, focused work is needed.

| Agent | What it does |
|---|---|
| [`scholar`](agents/scholar.md) | Searches PubMed and bioRxiv simultaneously, returns a clean paper list with ⚠️ preprint and 🔒 paywall markers, supports follow-up synthesis and saving |
| [`sentinel`](agents/sentinel.md) | Project coherence guard — audits `.neuroflow/` for drift, broken references, preregistration deviations, and plugin version sync; clears report after fixes |
| [`sentinel-dev`](agents/sentinel-dev.md) | Plugin development coherence guard — checks folder names vs frontmatter, README tables, version sync, dead references, command frontmatter completeness |

---

## Hooks

Hooks fire automatically on tool use events.

| Hook | Trigger | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| ruff formatter | `PostToolUse` — Edit / Write | Auto-formats any `.py` file written during a session |
| session logger | `PostToolUse` — Write / Edit / Bash | Appends a timestamped entry to today's `.neuroflow/sessions/YYYY-MM-DD.md` (only fires if `.neuroflow/` exists in the working directory) |

> **Pre-session orientation** is handled via `.claude/CLAUDE.md` injection — `/neuroflow` writes a neuroflow block there so Claude always knows the active phase and where to find project context.

---

## Project memory

Every neuroflow command writes its output to `.neuroflow/` at the root of your project repo. This is the shared memory of your project — readable by every command and agent, across sessions.

```
.neuroflow/
├── project_config.md       ← current phase, research question, tools, plugin_version — read by every command
├── flow.md                 ← index of all subfolders

```

## Installation

```bash
claude plugin marketplace add stanislavjiricek/neuroflow
claude plugin install neuroflow@neuroflow
```

Or from within Claude Code:

```
/plugin marketplace add stanislavjiricek/neuroflow
/plugin install neuroflow@neuroflow
```

For local development:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/stanislavjiricek/neuroflow
claude --plugin-dir ./neuroflow
```

Once installed, run `/neuroflow:neuroflow` in any project folder to get started.

## MCP server credentials

neuroflow uses four MCP servers that Claude Code launches automatically via `npx`. Two require credentials:

| Server | Package | Credentials needed |
|---|---|---|
| PubMed | `pubmed-mcp-server` | `PUBMED_EMAIL` — any email (required by NCBI for API access) |
| bioRxiv | `paper-search-mcp-nodejs` | none |
| Miro | `@k-jarzyna/mcp-miro` | `MIRO_ACCESS_TOKEN` — personal access token from Miro |
| Context7 | `@upstash/context7-mcp` | none |

### Setup wizard

Run `/neuroflow:setup` (or answer **Y** when prompted during `/neuroflow:neuroflow`) to enter a guided wizard:

1. **PubMed** — enter your email address. Validated for `@` format. Skippable.
2. **Miro** — paste a personal access token from your [Miro developer settings](https://miro.com/app/settings/user-profile/apps). Skippable.

Credentials are saved to **`.neuroflow/integrations.json`** in your project folder. This file is excluded from git (see `.gitignore`) so it is never committed.

### Activating credentials

After running `/setup`, export the env vars in your shell before starting Claude Code:

```bash
export PUBMED_EMAIL="you@example.com"
export MIRO_ACCESS_TOKEN="eyJ..."
```

Add these to your shell profile (`~/.zshrc`, `~/.bashrc`) so they load automatically on every session.

Alternatively, you can set the env vars directly without running the wizard — the plugin will use whichever values are present in the environment.

### What is automatic vs manual

| Step | Automatic | Manual |
|---|---|---|
| MCP server processes started | ✅ Claude Code launches them via `npx` | — |
| PubMed email entry | ✅ Prompted by `/setup` wizard | — |
| Miro token entry | ✅ Prompted by `/setup` wizard | ⚠️ You must create the token in the Miro browser UI first |
| Miro OAuth browser login | ❌ Not implemented (by design — browser OAuth from a terminal subprocess is not feasible without a redirect server) | Use a personal access token instead |
| Env var export | ❌ Not automatic | Run `export …` or add to shell profile |

### Reminder behavior

- If you skip setup and later run `/neuroflow:ideation` → **Explore literature**, the plugin will detect that `PUBMED_EMAIL` is missing and offer to run `/neuroflow:setup` before searching.
- If you mention Miro during ideation and `MIRO_ACCESS_TOKEN` is missing, the same reminder appears.
- You can always re-run `/neuroflow:setup` to add or update credentials.

## Contributing

neuroflow is intentionally small right now — and that's the point. It is designed to grow with the community.

If you work in neuroscience and have a workflow that Claude could help with, contributions are very welcome:

- **New skills** — domain knowledge for a modality, analysis method, or writing task
- **New commands** — multi-step pipelines for common research workflows
- **New agents** — autonomous subprocesses for focused tasks

See [`neuroflow:neuroflow-develop`](skills/neuroflow-develop/SKILL.md) for the development guide, or open an issue to discuss an idea before building.
